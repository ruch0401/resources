# Resources

This is a temporary resource repository to host any resource that needs to be served via HTTP(S) so that it could be used for any sort of development. For eg. referencing images using the `src` property in the `img` tag for getting image over the internet.

```html
<img  class="markers" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruch0401/resources/main/RedArrowDown.png" alt="red-arrow-down">
